# Spitball: Your Flutter Architecture Playground üöÄ

Ever asked "What's the best Flutter architecture?" and got the answer, *"It depends"*?

This project is the answer to **what it depends on**.

> **Spitball** is a simple game app built multiple times with different architectural patterns. It's a living laboratory designed to give you a hands-on feel for the trade-offs, benefits, and real-world application of each approach.

Welcome! If you've just come from one of my Medium articles, you're in the right place.

## Project Origins üìú

This Flutter project is a modern remake and architectural exploration of the original 'Spitball' game, which was first built for Android in native Java back in 2016. It serves as a great example of how development practices and architectural thinking have evolved.

You can find the original Android project here: [**Spitball for Android**](https://github.com/juanmadelboca/spitball-android).

## The Mission üéØ

This repository isn't just about building one app; it's about exploring solutions to a common problem. Our mission is to:

* **Explore Trade-offs:** Practically demonstrate how different architectures handle the same set of problems.
* **Provide a Learning Resource:** Offer a clear, well-documented codebase for junior to semi-senior developers to learn from.
* **Showcase Flexibility:** Create a foundation that can easily be adapted to different state management solutions (`flutter_bloc`, `riverpod`, `provider`) and backends (`Firebase`, etc.).

## Our First Stop: Clean Architecture üßº

The `main` branch is built using a strict implementation of **Clean Architecture**. This pattern excels at creating a clear separation of concerns, making your app:



* ‚úÖ **Framework Independent:** The core business logic is pure Dart and knows nothing about Flutter.
* ‚úÖ **Highly Testable:** Each layer (UI, Business Logic, Data) can be tested in isolation.
* ‚úÖ **Scalable & Maintainable:** Features are self-contained, making them easy to add, change, or remove.

#### At a glance, our structure looks like this:

* `features/<feature_name>/presentation`: The UI Layer (Widgets, Pages, and BLoC).
* `features/<feature_name>/domain`: The Core Logic (Entities, Use Cases, and Repository Contracts).
* `features/<feature_name>/data`: The Implementation Details (Repository Implementations, API/DB Data Sources).

#### Key Tools Used:

* **State Management:** `flutter_bloc`
* **Dependency Injection:** `get_it`
* **Error Handling:** `dartz` (for the `Either` type)
* **Value Equality:** `equatable`

## The Journey Ahead üó∫Ô∏è

This is just the beginning! Future branches will explore other powerful architectures, including:

* **Riverpod & hooks** 
* **Provider-based Architecture**
* ...and more based on community feedback!
